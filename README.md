# Malware Detection
Malware Detection on Android Devices
This project aims to predict the detection of malware on Android devices using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains various features of Android apps, such as permissions requested, activities declared, and services used. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify apps as malware or benign.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle here. This is the dataset link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/android-malware-dataset-for-machine-learning 

Model
We experimented with several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN and ANNs. We achieved an accuracy nearing 99% on the test set.
